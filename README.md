# <Riddles>
A quiz game inspired by one of DC Comic's supervillians, The Riddler. The goal of the game is to answer 2 out of the 3 riddles in order to win. I choose this game because while I am notriously aweful at riddles, I love superheros and supervillians. Both riddles and coding having tested my paitence and logic so I belive to be an appropriate choice of a game to create.

# Next Steps

- One future inhancement to look forward to would be a countdown timer to limit the amount of time to answer the 3 riddles. 
- Another enhancement to look forward to is progression through levels that get harder as the game progresses.
